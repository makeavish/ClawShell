# Codex Native Hooks

Issue: [#23](https://github.com/makeavish/ClawShell/issues/23)

Source basis: [Codex Early Signal Check](codex-early-signal-check.md)

## Installed Config

ClawShell patches `~/.codex/config.toml` with one owned block marked by `com.clawshell.integration.codex-cli.v1`.

The owned block installs:

- Native Codex command hooks for `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop`
- A top-level legacy `notify` fallback
- A base64 copy of the previous top-level `notify` assignment when one existed

Existing user hooks are not rewritten. They remain outside the owned block. Removing the integration deletes only the owned block and restores the previous top-level `notify` assignment.

## Privacy Contract

Native Codex hook stdin is reduced before it reaches the control server. The adapter keeps only:

- Agent identity
- Resolved process id and process start time when available
- Event kind
- `session_id` or `turn_id` as the integration session id
- HMAC-SHA256 of `cwd` using the local ClawShell salt
- A stable namespaced replay id derived from native occurrence ids when possible

The adapter must not send prompt text, raw cwd, transcript paths, model names, permission mode, tool names, tool input, tool output, or assistant message text.

## Confidence Transitions

Process detection remains the liveness backup. A detected `codex` process creates or refreshes a process-scanned session with process-level confidence.

Native hooks provide integrated confidence:

- `SessionStart` creates or refreshes an integrated active session keyed by `session_id`, cwd hash, and process identity when available.
- `UserPromptSubmit` creates or refreshes an integrated active turn keyed by `turn_id`.
- `PreToolUse` keeps the matching turn active.
- `PostToolUse` keeps the matching turn active after tool completion because the agent may continue the turn.
- `Stop` moves the matching active turn to standing-by and starts the normal grace window.

Legacy Codex `notify` remains completion-only fallback evidence. It can move a matching active turn to standing-by, but it must not be treated as an early activity signal.

If the Codex process disappears, process reconciliation finishes the matching integrated session. If a native hook cannot be parsed or ClawShell is unavailable, the adapter exits successfully without blocking Codex.

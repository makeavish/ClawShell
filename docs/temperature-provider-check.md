## Question

Which fresh, permission-compatible temperature source is reliable enough for Bag Mode cutoff decisions?

## Method

Added `scripts/temperature-provider-validation.sh`, a non-destructive harness that does not use sudo and does not intentionally heat hardware.

Command used:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-validation.sh --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-validation/local-20260512T023358Z
```

Sources tested:

- Apple `ProcessInfo.thermalState`
- `pmset -g therm`
- `powermetrics -n 1 -i 1000 --samplers thermal`
- AppleSmartBattery top-level I/O Registry temperature and update fields

Reference:

- [Apple ProcessInfo.ThermalState](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/processinfo/thermalstate)

## Local Result

| Source | Permission behavior | Freshness/timeout behavior | Numeric temperature | Closed-bag coverage | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ProcessInfo.thermalState` | Works without root | Harness probe returned within 5s probe timeout; app API is not a shell command | No | Closed-bag coverage not proven; app-side coarse thermal-pressure/liveness signal only | Supplemental signal only |
| `pmset -g therm` | Works without root | Returned within the 1s command timeout | No current numeric temperature in this run | Warning history/status, not a sensor source | Not a cutoff provider |
| `powermetrics --samplers thermal` | Refused non-root execution with `powermetrics must be invoked as the superuser` | Returned within the 1s command timeout when non-root | Not available without root | Not validated in this artifact | Follow-up required |
| AppleSmartBattery I/O Registry fields | Works without root when battery service exists | Returned within the 1s command timeout; update age was 12s in this run, above the 10s freshness target | Battery pack/virtual values were present | Battery temperature does not prove CPU/package or closed-bag thermal coverage | Context only |
| SMAppService helper `powermetrics --samplers thermal` | Ad-hoc/no-membership helper launched as root | Timed out after partial output; captured thermal pressure only | No numeric temperature observed | Not validated; no cutoff signal captured | Helper path viable, command not proven |
| SMAppService helper `powermetrics --samplers all` | Same no-membership helper launched as root | 1s run produced only the command header; 5s diagnostic emitted broad task/power output but still timed out | No trustworthy numeric temperature observed after detector correction | Not validated; no cutoff signal captured | Diagnostic only; command not viable as provider |
| SMAppService helper `ioreg -r -c AppleSMCKeysEndpoint -l` | Same no-membership helper launched as root | 1s run timed out after partial I/O Registry output | Numeric-looking SMC/thermal candidates observed before timeout | Not validated; no freshness/cadence/coverage proof | Diagnostic candidate only |

Captured values from `validation-config.txt`:

```

## Failure Behavior

Production Bag Mode must fail closed for:

- provider unavailable
- stale reading
- permission denied
- parse failure
- helper crash or timeout
- unsupported hardware

The harness records these as evidence fields but does not enable production behavior.

The mocked fail-closed contract is now executable in `BagModeSafetyPolicy` and covered by the portable `ClawShellCoreChecks` gate. Those checks cover warning, cutoff, stale, unavailable, permission-denied, parse-failed, helper-crashed, unsupported-hardware, timeout, coverage-insufficient, missing/invalid battery, battery floor, and hysteresis behavior. They do not select a production provider or prove helper-side sampling.

## Helper-Equivalent Readiness

Added `scripts/temperature-provider-helper-readiness.sh`, a non-mutating
preflight for the helper/root sampling path. It never prompts for sudo. When
the current user is not root, it uses `sudo -n` only so missing authorization is
recorded as evidence instead of blocking the run.

Command used:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-helper-readiness.sh --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-helper-readiness/recheck-20260512T100451Z
```

Captured values from `validation-config.txt`:

```text
hardwareArch=arm64
runningAsRoot=false
effectiveUserIdRedacted=true
batteryPresent=true
powermetricsAvailable=true
sudoNonInteractiveAvailable=false
powermetricsHelperPermissionState=sudoPasswordRequired
powermetricsHelperTimedOut=false
powermetricsHelperExitCode=1
numericTemperatureOutput=false
helperSamplingCandidateAvailable=false
providerProofReady=false
```

This preflight explained the earlier non-interactive shell blocker. The later
SMAppService run below moved past that blocker by launching the provider helper
as root; the current local blocker is now provider output quality, not helper
authorization.

## No-Membership SMAppService Provider Runs

The no-membership `SMAppService` provider artifact
`.build/temperature-provider-proof/smappservice-unique-20260512T175157Z`
reached the approval/enabled path and produced root-owned runtime evidence from
a system LaunchDaemon with a unique ad-hoc bundle/helper identity. Its register
capture still includes the expected `Operation not permitted` transition before
approval, and it did not capture unregister cleanup.

Relevant lifecycle evidence therefore combines the earlier unregister-capable
`smappservice-real` artifact with the newer unique-identity root-runtime
captures:

```text
statusAfterRegisterRaw=2
statusAfterApprovalRaw=1
launchctlRuns=1
helperRuntimeUid=0
helperRuntimeEuid=0
unregisterStatusBeforeRaw=1
unregisterStatusAfterRaw=0
launchctlAfterUnregister=service-not-found
```

The helper runtime proved root ownership. With the default `thermal` sampler,
the command produced thermal pressure state but no usable numeric provider
sample:

```text
command=/usr/bin/powermetrics --show-initial-usage -n 1 -i 1000 --samplers thermal
timeoutSeconds=1
timedOut=true
durationSeconds=2
helperOwned=true
numericTemperatureObserved=false
```

The later `.build/temperature-provider-proof/smappservice-all-20260512T181830Z`
artifact used the same helper path with `--samplers all`. It confirmed the
LaunchDaemon arguments and root-owned helper execution, but the 1 second run
timed out before a sampler body was captured. This is runtime-capture evidence,
not verifier-accepted #25 proof:

```text
command=/usr/bin/powermetrics --show-initial-usage -n 1 -i 1000 --samplers all
timeoutSeconds=1
timedOut=true
durationSeconds=2
helperOwned=true
numericTemperatureObserved=false
```

The 5 second diagnostic artifact
`.build/temperature-provider-proof/smappservice-all-timeout5-20260512T182146Z`
emitted broad `powermetrics --samplers all` output, but still timed out and did
not contain a trustworthy numeric temperature reading. Its original
`numericTemperatureObserved=true` was a detector false positive from task-table
output. The artifact still stores that old field value, so the corrected result
is an interpretation from the hardened detector and captured output, not a
promoted artifact row.

The later `.build/temperature-provider-proof/ioreg-smc-prepare-20260513T061711Z`
artifact used the same no-membership `SMAppService` path with
`CLAWSHELL_TEMPERATURE_PROVIDER_SOURCE=ioreg-smc`. After registration, approval,
and a wait of at least 15 seconds before post-approval capture, the helper ran as root and
captured partial `AppleSMCKeysEndpoint` output:

```text
command=/usr/sbin/ioreg -r -c AppleSMCKeysEndpoint -l
providerSource=ioreg-smc
timeoutSeconds=1
timedOut=true
exitCode=15
helperOwned=true
numericTemperatureObserved=true
```

This is source-candidate evidence only. The command still timed out under the
current 1 second contract, and the artifact does not prove freshness, cadence,
closed-bag coverage, fail-closed behavior, or a bounded production parser.

The follow-up `.build/temperature-provider-proof/bounded-ioreg-smc-local`
artifact updates the generated helper to write provider stdout/stderr to
temporary files instead of pipes, then read back at most 2,000,000 bytes per
stream. A direct local run of the generated helper binary with
`providerSource=ioreg-smc` completed inside the 1 second timeout:

```text
command=/usr/sbin/ioreg -r -c AppleSMCKeysEndpoint -l
providerSource=ioreg-smc
timeoutSeconds=1
durationSeconds=1
timedOut=false
exitCode=0
stdoutBytes=878324
stdoutTruncated=false
helperOwned=false
numericTemperatureObserved=true
```

This narrows the previous timeout to a pipe-drain bug in the prototype helper,
but it is still not provider proof: the direct run was not root/helper-owned, the
numeric candidates are still battery-context values in the I/O Registry output,
and freshness, cadence, coverage, and fail-closed behavior remain unproven.

The bounded SMAppService artifact
`.build/temperature-provider-proof/ioreg-smc-bounded-smappservice-20260513T071633Z`
then ran the same source through the approved no-membership helper after the
required wait of at least 15 seconds:

```text
command=/usr/sbin/ioreg -r -c AppleSMCKeysEndpoint -l
providerSource=ioreg-smc
timeoutSeconds=1
durationSeconds=1
timedOut=false
exitCode=0
stdoutBytes=878309
stdoutTruncated=false
helperOwned=true
numericTemperatureObserved=true
```

That `numericTemperatureObserved=true` field was recorded before the helper
harness rejected `ioreg-smc` battery-context candidates. New `ioreg-smc`
artifacts treat numeric matches under `AppleSmartBattery` or
`AppleSmartBatteryManager` as rejected cutoff candidates and record
`numericTemperatureRejectionReason=ioreg-smc-battery-context-only` when no
non-battery numeric candidate is present.

Cleanup succeeded: `unregister()` moved status back to raw `0`, and `launchctl`
could not find the service after unregister. The verifier still fails as
expected because manifest rows for freshness, cadence, coverage, and fail-closed
behavior remain `TODO`.

The numeric-looking values in this artifact are under `AppleSmartBattery`:

```text
+-o AppleSmartBatteryManager
  +-o AppleSmartBattery
      "BatteryData" = {...}
      "Temperature" = 3044
      "VirtualTemperature" = 3119
```

That makes the source useful as bounded helper/runtime evidence, but not a
production cutoff provider by itself. Battery-context values still do not prove
CPU/package or closed-bag thermal coverage.

These artifacts are useful evidence for the no-membership helper mechanism and
candidate-source discovery, not proof of a production temperature provider. New
`ioreg-smc` proof attempts reject the battery-context candidates for production
cutoff evidence, so the next #25 work should capture freshness, cadence,
closed-bag coverage, and fail-closed evidence for a better source.

## Conclusion

No production Bag Mode temperature provider is selected from the non-root
sources, helper-owned `powermetrics` variants, or the helper-owned `ioreg-smc`
diagnostic source tested.

`ProcessInfo.thermalState` is permission-compatible and useful as a supplemental app-side thermal-pressure/liveness signal, but it is coarse, non-numeric, and does not prove closed-bag coverage. `pmset -g therm` did not provide current numeric temperature evidence. AppleSmartBattery temperature is useful context when present, but it is not enough for CPU/package or closed-bag thermal risk and did not meet the 10 second freshness target in the local run. The no-membership `SMAppService` path can launch a helper as root on this machine. The tested `powermetrics` sampler variants did not provide a trustworthy numeric cutoff source. The bounded `ioreg-smc` diagnostic path now runs as root through SMAppService without timing out, but its observed `AppleSmartBattery` values are rejected as production cutoff candidates and do not prove CPU/package or closed-bag thermal coverage; [#25](https://github.com/makeavish/ClawShell/issues/25) must still prove helper/root non-battery numeric output, freshness, cadence, timeout, and coverage.

Production Bag Mode remains blocked until [#25](https://github.com/makeavish/ClawShell/issues/25) validates a no-membership helper or helper-equivalent provider that can supply fresh, permission-compatible thermal evidence with the required fail-closed behavior.

## Helper Provider Proof Verifier

Before attaching helper/helper-equivalent provider proof to #25, run:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-proof-verify.sh \
  --manifest .build/temperature-provider-proof/<case-id>/provider-manifest.tsv
```

To capture the first no-prompt `powermetrics` proof attempt without waiting for
an interactive helper/root flow, run:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-powermetrics-proof.sh \
  --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-proof/powermetrics-attempt-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
```

This package records the prompt-free `powermetrics` attempt, permission state,
timeout behavior, ProcessInfo supplemental state, and numeric output if
available. On the current machine, non-interactive sampling still records
`sudoPasswordRequired`, so the package remains incomplete proof until helper or
root-equivalent sampling is available.

To inventory non-`powermetrics` source candidates for future helper-owned
sampling without sudo, run:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-alt-source-probe.sh \
  --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-proof/alt-source-probe-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
```

This captures local SMC, PMU temperature sensor, die temperature controller, and
IOReport-style surfaces as discovery evidence. It also writes
`evidence/numeric-temperature-candidates.txt`, a bounded list of captured lines
that look like labeled numeric temperature values and should be reviewed before
the next helper-owned provider attempt. Generic `die-id`, `die-count`, and
`*-temp` table/interface identifiers are intentionally excluded from that
candidate list. The probe does not select a provider or promote numeric cutoff
proof; `providerProofReady=false` remains expected until helper-owned numeric
output, freshness, cadence, timeout behavior, and closed-bag coverage are
proven.

To build the no-membership `SMAppService` provider candidate without changing
helper registration state, run:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-smappservice-proof.sh \
  --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-proof/smappservice-prepare-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
```

The default mode builds an ad-hoc signed app/helper bundle whose LaunchDaemon
helper runs one timeout-bounded `powermetrics` sample after registration and
approval. New artifacts still default to `powermetrics --show-initial-usage -n
1 -i 1000 --samplers thermal` for reproducible comparison with existing
evidence, but the current local conclusion is that the tested `powermetrics`
variants are not the primary path to a provider-ready numeric cutoff source.
Use `CLAWSHELL_TEMPERATURE_PROVIDER_SHOW_INITIAL_USAGE=false` or
`CLAWSHELL_TEMPERATURE_PROVIDER_POWERMETRICS_SAMPLERS=<samplers>` only for
comparison runs, for example `all`, `default`, `cpu_power`, or
`thermal,cpu_power`.

To generate the helper-owned I/O Registry SMC diagnostic source, create the
artifact with:

```bash
CLAWSHELL_TEMPERATURE_PROVIDER_SOURCE=ioreg-smc \
  scripts/temperature-provider-smappservice-proof.sh \
  --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-proof/ioreg-smc-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
```

That source runs `/usr/sbin/ioreg -r -c AppleSMCKeysEndpoint -l` from the
approved helper. The generated helper writes provider stdout/stderr to temporary
files and reads back at most 2,000,000 bytes per stream so large I/O Registry
output does not block on a full pipe. New `ioreg-smc` artifacts reject numeric
matches under `AppleSmartBattery` or `AppleSmartBatteryManager` and report
`numericTemperatureRejectionReason=ioreg-smc-battery-context-only` when those
are the only candidates. The bounded SMAppService run is root-owned and
no-timeout, but it is still candidate-source evidence rather than provider
proof because freshness, cadence, closed-bag coverage, fail-closed evidence,
and a non-battery numeric cutoff source are still missing.

Each new artifact also gets a unique SMAppService bundle/helper identity derived
from its output path. This avoids reusing stale macOS approval/code-signing state
between ad-hoc proof attempts. To force a deterministic suffix for comparison
runs, set `CLAWSHELL_TEMPERATURE_PROVIDER_ID_SUFFIX=<lettersAndDigits>`.
Mutating registration uses the same prepared artifact and requires:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-smappservice-proof.sh \
  --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-proof/<same-smappservice-provider-artifact> \
  --register \
  --i-understand-this-registers-provider
```

After approval, wait at least 15 seconds, then append non-mutating provider
output from the same artifact with:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-smappservice-proof.sh \
  --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-proof/<same-smappservice-provider-artifact> \
  --capture-post-approval
```

The append mode captures helper runtime context, provider output/status,
`launchctl`, and unified logs. It does not promote manifest rows automatically;
review the captured output before mapping it to provider proof rows.

After cleanup approval, unregister the same prototype helper with:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-smappservice-proof.sh \
  --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-proof/<same-smappservice-provider-artifact> \
  --capture-unregister \
  --i-understand-this-registers-provider
```

This records follow-up status, `launchctl`, and unified log output for cleanup.

To start the package layout without inventing rows by hand, generate a
non-mutating scaffold:

```bash
scripts/temperature-provider-proof-scaffold.sh \
  --output-dir .build/temperature-provider-proof/<case-id>
```

The scaffold is not evidence. It intentionally omits `validation-config.txt`
and `manual-result.md`, and writes `TODO` manifest rows so the verifier fails
until real helper/root provider output is captured.

The verifier expects three files at the manifest root:

- `validation-config.txt`
- `manual-result.md`
- `provider-manifest.tsv`

`validation-config.txt` must record the machine-readable proof shape:

```text
evidenceFormat=temperature-provider-proof-v1
metadataRedacted=true
macOSVersion=15.0
cpu=Apple Silicon
hardwareClass=MacBook
providerSource=powermetrics
helperOwned=true
processInfoSupplementalOnly=true
numericCutoffSource=true
noUserVisiblePrompts=true
freshnessMaxAgeSeconds=10
activeCadenceSeconds=5
idleCadenceSeconds=30
timeoutSeconds=1
closedBagCoverage=requires-combined-signals
failClosedContract=covered
result=inconclusive
```

`manual-result.md` must use filled checklist fields:

```markdown
# Temperature Provider Proof Result

## Provider Case
- Case ID: apple-silicon-powermetrics-helper
- Provider source: powermetrics
- Helper-owned provider: yes
- Numeric cutoff source: yes
- No user-visible prompts: yes
- ProcessInfo role: supplemental-only

## Sampling
- Freshest reading age seconds: 4
- Active cadence seconds: 5
- Idle cadence seconds: 30
- Timeout seconds: 1

## Coverage
- Closed-bag coverage: requires-combined-signals
- Fail-closed cases recorded: yes

## Conclusion
- Result: inconclusive
```

The verifier compares `manual-result.md` against `validation-config.txt` for
provider source, freshness, cadence, timeout, closed-bag coverage, and result.

`provider-manifest.tsv` must use this tab-separated header:

```tsv
checkId	status	evidencePath	note
```

Required manifest `checkId` rows:

- `provider-command-or-api`
- `helper-ownership-context`
- `numeric-temperature-output`
- `freshness-samples`
- `active-cadence-samples`
- `idle-cadence-samples`
- `timeout-enforcement`
- `timeout-fail-closed`
- `permission-behavior`
- `no-user-visible-prompts`
- `closed-bag-coverage-analysis`
- `processinfo-supplemental-signal`
- `safety-contract-tests`
- `unavailable-fail-closed`
- `stale-fail-closed`
- `permission-denied-fail-closed`
- `parse-failed-fail-closed`
- `helper-crashed-fail-closed`
- `unsupported-hardware-fail-closed`
- `logs`

Optional manifest rows are:

- `combined-sensor-signal`, required when `closedBagCoverage=requires-combined-signals`
- `provider-update-or-restart`, when the prototype exercises provider restart/update behavior

Required rows must use `status=evidence`. Optional rows may use
`status=evidence` or `status=n/a` with an explicit note, except
`combined-sensor-signal` must be evidence when
`closedBagCoverage=requires-combined-signals`.

Example manifest row:

```tsv
numeric-temperature-output	evidence	evidence/numeric-temperature-output.txt	captured helper output attached
```

Evidence paths must be relative, non-empty, inside the evidence package, and free
of symlink components. Evidence files must contain real captured output rather
than `TODO`, `<paste output>`, or placeholder text. Verifier success is
structural only; it does not prove the provider is reliable or close #25.

# Changelog

## v0.2.5 - 2026-05-19

- Aligns Claude Code and Codex CLI completion behavior so `Stop` releases the
  protected turn immediately for both agents.
- Allows a later Claude Code prompt in the same native session to start a fresh
  AgentWake turn, while `SessionEnd` remains terminal.
- Reduces the default fallback release window to 1 minute and migrates the
  legacy 15-minute default.
- Wires Lid-Closed Awake safety to a direct IOReport temperature provider for
  cutoff preflight/release when samples are usable, with fail-closed handling for
  untrusted provider output.

## v0.2.4 - 2026-05-19

- Fixes the Settings window so long content scrolls inside the window instead
  of extending off-screen.
- Keeps the Settings window within the visible screen area on smaller displays.

## v0.2.3 - 2026-05-19

- Replaces the visible detected-session manual protection control with a
  duration-based Keep Mac Active control.
- Adds manual Mac-active choices for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, and
  indefinitely, plus an explicit stop action.
- Fixes Lid-Closed Awake status on Macs where `pmset -g live` reports
  `SleepDisabled=1` but `pmset -g custom` omits `disablesleep`.

## v0.2.2 - 2026-05-18

Settings and safety polish release:

- Adds configurable Lid-Closed Awake safety thresholds in Settings.
- Enforces release-only battery floor and direct temperature cutoffs while
  Lid-Closed Awake is active.
- Replaces the Settings pause dropdown with an explicit duration sheet.
- Fixes safety controls so they are clickable and use one-step increments.
- Clarifies launch-at-login status copy and hides misleading off-state text.
- Makes uninstall remove hooks, restore AgentWake-owned Lid-Closed Awake state,
  move the app bundle to Trash, and quit.
- Aligns local build bundle versions with the latest release tag for better
  diagnostics.

## v0.2.1 - 2026-05-17

Menu bar and first-run UX polish release:

- Replaces the static menu bar wordmark with glanceable state icons.
- Keeps menu actions enabled in the menu bar app.
- Uses adaptive menu bar icon tint so the icon remains visible across menu bar
  appearances.
- Clarifies session copy, including detected sessions that can also be kept
  awake.
- Adds first-run onboarding, integration details, per-agent enable toggles, and
  pause/resume controls.
- Explains Lid-Closed Awake administrator permission before macOS asks for it.
- Shows Lid-Closed Awake safety warnings while battery and thermal cutoffs are
  still pending.
- Keeps onboarding and permission prompts frontmost when other apps are active.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-05-15

Session and UX polish release:

- Adds concise menu/settings copy: `found`, `keeping awake`, `Keep Awake`,
  and `Stop Keeping Awake`.
- Detects the primary Codex Desktop app-server after AgentWake starts, while
  still treating it as found-only until trusted activity or manual action.
- Reuses Codex process-backed sessions across new turn IDs to avoid duplicate
  session rows.
- Releases Codex protection on `Stop`/completion, and expires stale
  `PostToolUse` holds when Codex does not send a completion hook.
- Adds `Stop Keeping Awake` to release current sleep protection from the menu.
- Hides installed integration rows from the short menu and shows repair only
  when an integration needs attention.
- Refreshes the Settings window while it is visible.
- Removes success popups for routine menu/settings actions.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-15

First public release scope:

- Keeps the Mac awake through validated normal sleep-prevention paths while
  Claude Code or Codex CLI sessions are active.
- Can manually protect already-running detected sessions until those processes
  exit.
- Shows current hold state from the menu bar app and CLI.
- Installs and reports first-class Claude Code and Codex CLI integrations where
  their local configuration surfaces are available.
- Releases sleep prevention when watched agent sessions finish, expire their
  grace window, or the user pauses/releases AgentWake.
- Includes local-only logs and status surfaces for integration setup, helper
  fallback outcomes, and release decisions.

Closed-Lid Mode status:

- Closed-Lid Mode can be enabled or disabled for local testing with macOS
  administrator approval.
- The implementation toggles `pmset disablesleep`, records the prior value, and
  restores that value when disabled.
- In this first release, live temperature-provider cutoff automation was
  deferred; users should treat this as an explicit local/admin-approved mode.
- The CLI accepts the product-facing `agentwake closed-lid status|enable|disable`
  path.

Release notes:

- No Apple Developer Program membership is required for the v1 normal
  sleep-prevention scope.
- Normal runtime/use does not require admin privileges.
- The product rename uses fresh AgentWake local state under
  `~/Library/Application Support/AgentWake/`; old pre-release AgentWake state is
  not migrated. AgentWake does clean up legacy AgentWake-owned Claude Code and
  Codex CLI integration hooks during integration install/remove.
- Any future Closed-Lid Mode helper/admin approval flow is outside this release
  and is tracked separately in the post-v1 readiness issue.
